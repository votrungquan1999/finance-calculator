Compound interest calculates returns on both your original investment and all previously earned interest, creating exponential growth over time.

          text: "Our calculator uses monthly compounding, which is more accurate for most investment scenarios. Monthly compounding means interest is calculated and added to your investment every month, providing more frequent compounding compared to annual calculations and resulting in slightly higher returns.",

For example, if you expect 8% annual returns and 3% inflation, use 5% as your interest rate. This gives you the purchasing power of your future investment value in today's dollars.",
