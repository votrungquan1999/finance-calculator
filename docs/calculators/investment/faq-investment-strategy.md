## Investment Strategy FAQ (Q15-Q20)

### Q15: How do I choose between pre-tax and Roth contributions?

**Answer**: Consider your current vs future tax bracket:

- Pre-tax: Lower current taxes, taxed on withdrawal
- Roth: Higher current taxes, tax-free withdrawal
- If current bracket > future bracket: Pre-tax
- If current bracket < future bracket: Roth

**Tax Bracket Comparison**:

```
Current: 24% bracket
Future: 22% bracket
Choice: Pre-tax (save 24% now, pay 22% later)

Current: 22% bracket
Future: 24% bracket
Choice: Roth (pay 22% now, avoid 24% later)
```

**Other Considerations**:

- Tax diversification
- RMD requirements
- Estate planning
- State taxes

**Next Steps**:

1. Determine current and future tax brackets
2. Consider tax diversification
3. Factor in RMD requirements
4. Review strategy annually

### Q16: What's the difference between nominal and real returns?

**Answer**: Key difference:

- Nominal returns: Actual percentage return
- Real returns: Nominal return adjusted for inflation
- Formula: Real Return = ((1 + Nominal) ÷ (1 + Inflation)) - 1
- Real returns show true purchasing power

**Real Return Examples**:

```
7% nominal, 3% inflation = 3.88% real
5% nominal, 3% inflation = 1.94% real
10% nominal, 3% inflation = 6.80% real
```

**Why It Matters**:

- Shows true purchasing power
- Important for long-term planning
- Helps set realistic expectations
- Accounts for inflation impact

**Next Steps**:

1. Use real returns for long-term planning
2. Consider inflation in all calculations
3. Set realistic expectations
4. Review assumptions annually

**Answer**: Rebalancing maintains your target asset allocation:

**Rebalancing Example**:

```

```
