## Refinancing Scenarios

<details>

- **Closing Costs:** $4,000

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⏰ Term Shortening</strong></summary>

**When it makes sense:**

- You can afford higher monthly payments

**Example:**

- **Current:** 6.5% rate, $200,000 balance, 25 years remaining
- **New:** 6.0% rate, $200,000 balance, 15 years remaining
- **Payment Increase:** $400/month
- **Interest Savings:** $89,000
- **Time Saved:** 10 years

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Cash-Out Refinance</strong></summary>

**When it makes sense:**

- You have significant home equity
- You need cash for major expenses
- New rate is still favorable

**Example:**

- **Current:** 6.5% rate, $200,000 balance, 25 years remaining
- **Home Value:** $400,000
- **New:** 6.0% rate, $300,000 balance, 30 years remaining
- **Cash Out:** $100,000
- **Payment Increase:** $200/month

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🔄 ARM to Fixed Conversion</strong></summary>

**When it makes sense:**

- You want payment stability
- Fixed rates are reasonable

**Example:**

- **Current:** 5/1 ARM at 4.5%, adjusting to 6.5%
- **New:** 30-year fixed at 6.0%
- **Payment Increase:** $200/month
- **Rate Stability:** Fixed for 30 years

</details>

## Break-Even Analysis

### 🧮 Break-Even Calculation

**Formula:** Break-Even Months = Closing Costs ÷ Monthly Savings

| Closing Costs | Monthly Savings | Break-Even Time |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| $2,000        | $100            | 20 months       |
| $4,000        | $150            | 27 months       |
| $6,000        | $200            | 30 months       |
| $8,000        | $250            | 32 months       |

### 📊 Break-Even Factors

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Closing Costs</strong></summary>

**Typical closing costs (2-5% of loan amount):**

- **Origination fees:** 0.5-1%
- **Title insurance:** $500-1,500
- **Appraisal:** $300-600
- **Recording fees:** $100-300
- **Attorney fees:** $500-1,000

**Ways to reduce:**

- Lender credits
- No-cost refinancing
- Shop around for services

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 Monthly Savings</strong></summary>

**Factors affecting savings:**

- **Rate difference:** Larger difference = more savings
- **Loan balance:** Higher balance = more savings
- **Term length:** Longer term = more savings
- **Payment frequency:** Bi-weekly vs monthly

**Calculate accurately:**

- Include all loan costs
- Factor in escrow changes
- Consider PMI changes

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⏰ Time to Break-Even</strong></summary>

**Consider your timeline:**

- **Planning to move soon:** May not be worth it
- **Staying long-term:** More likely to benefit

**Rule of thumb:** Break-even should be within 2-3 years
