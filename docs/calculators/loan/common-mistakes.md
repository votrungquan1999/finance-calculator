## Overview

This document covers the most common mistakes users make when using the Loan Calculators, with detailed explanations, real-world examples, and actionable solutions.

## Loan Calculator Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Only Comparing Monthly Payments

**The Problem**: Users focus only on monthly payment without considering total cost.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Lower payment often means higher total cost
- Ignores interest rate differences
- Misses long-term impact
- Poor financial decision making

**The Solution**: Always compare total interest and total cost, not just monthly payments.

**Real Example**:

- 30-year $1,500/month vs 15-year $2,000/month
- The 15-year saves $100,000 in interest despite higher payment
- Total cost is much lower

**How to Avoid**:

- Calculate total interest for each option
- Compare total cost, not just payment
- Consider your timeline and goals
- Factor in opportunity cost

### Mistake 2: Not Considering Opportunity Cost

**The Problem**: Extra payments vs investing decision without comparing returns.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Money has alternative uses
- Might provide better returns elsewhere
- Misses investment opportunities
- Poor resource allocation

**The Solution**: Compare extra payment return (loan rate) to expected investment return.

**Real Example**:

- 3.5% mortgage vs 7% investment return
- Investing might be better, but consider risk tolerance
- Factor in tax benefits and risk

**How to Avoid**:

- Compare loan rate to expected investment return
- Consider your risk tolerance
- Factor in tax benefits
- Make informed decision

### Mistake 3: Extending Loan Term Unnecessarily

**The Problem**: Choosing longer term just to lower payment.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Longer term means more total interest
- Reduces equity building
- Increases total cost
- Poor financial planning

**The Solution**: Choose shortest term you can comfortably afford.

**Real Example**:

- 40-year mortgage saves $200/month
- But costs $150,000 more in interest
- Much higher total cost

**How to Avoid**:

- Calculate total cost for different terms
- Choose shortest affordable term
- Consider extra payments instead
- Factor in your timeline

### Mistake 4: Not Shopping Around for Rates

**The Problem**: Accepting first rate offered.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Rates vary significantly between lenders
- Misses better deals
- Pays more than necessary
- Poor comparison shopping

**The Solution**: Get quotes from multiple lenders and compare.

**Real Example**:

- Lender A: 6.5%, Lender B: 6.0%
- Shopping around saves $32,000 over 30 years
- Significant long-term savings

**How to Avoid**:

- Get quotes from at least 3 lenders
- Compare APR, not just rate
- Consider all costs
- Don't accept first offer

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Closing Costs

**The Problem**: Not factoring in all costs when comparing loans.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Closing costs can be significant
- Affects total cost comparison
- Misses true cost of borrowing
- Poor decision making

**The Solution**: Include all costs in comparison and calculate break-even point.

**Real Example**:

- 6.0% rate with $8,000 closing costs
- vs 6.5% rate with $2,000 closing costs
- Need to calculate break-even point

**How to Avoid**:

- Get detailed closing cost estimates
- Compare total cost, not just rate
- Calculate break-even point
- Factor in your timeline

### Mistake 6: Not Understanding Loan Types

**The Problem**: Choosing wrong loan type for needs.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Different loan types have different purposes
- May not meet your needs
- Poor financial fit
- Misses optimization opportunities

**The Solution**: Understand each loan type and choose based on your needs.

**Real Example**:

- Using declining balance for standard mortgage
- When equal payment would be better
- Choose based on your situation

**How to Avoid**:

- Understand each loan type
- Choose based on your needs
- Consider payment predictability
- Factor in total cost

### Mistake 7: Not Considering Prepayment Penalties

**The Problem**: Not checking for prepayment penalties.

**Why It's Wrong**:

- Penalties reduce benefits of extra payments
- May not be worth it
- Hidden costs
- Poor planning

**The Solution**: Check for prepayment penalties and factor into decision.

**Real Example**:

- 2% prepayment penalty on $300K loan
- Extra payments may not be worth it
- Consider other strategies

**How to Avoid**:

- Read all loan terms carefully
- Ask about prepayment penalties
- Factor into decision
- Consider alternatives
