## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**This calculator is fully implemented and available for use.**

## Overview

This document provides detailed examples and scenarios for the Annuity Method (Equal Payment loans), showing how fixed payment loans work in practice and helping users understand the true cost of borrowing.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: 30-Year Mortgage
**Scenario**: $300,000 home purchase with 6.5% interest
- Loan Amount: $300,000
- Interest Rate: 6.5% annually
- Term: 30 years

**Calculation**:
- Monthly Rate: 6.5% / 12 = 0.5417%
- Number of Payments: 30 × 12 = 360
- Monthly Payment: $1,896.20

**Key Results**:
- Total Interest: $382,632
- Total Paid: $682,632
- Interest as % of Total: 56%

**Key Insight**: Over 30 years, you pay more in interest than the original loan amount

### Example 2: Auto Loan Comparison
**Scenario**: $25,000 car with different loan terms
- Loan Amount: $25,000
- Interest Rate: 7% annually

**3-Year Term**:
- Monthly Payment: $771.81
- Total Interest: $2,785
- Total Paid: $27,785

**5-Year Term**:
- Monthly Payment: $495.03
- Total Interest: $4,702
- Total Paid: $29,702

**Key Insight**: Longer terms reduce monthly payment but increase total interest significantly

### Example 3: Refinancing Analysis
**Scenario**: Existing $200,000 mortgage at 7.5%, refinancing to 6%
- Current Payment: $1,398.43
- New Payment: $1,199.10
- Monthly Savings: $199.33
- Refinancing Cost: $3,000

**Break-Even Analysis**:
- Break-even point: $3,000 ÷ $199.33 = 15 months
- If staying longer than 15 months, refinancing saves money

**Key Insight**: Refinancing costs must be recovered through payment savings

### Example 4: Personal Loan
**Scenario**: $15,000 personal loan for debt consolidation
- Loan Amount: $15,000
- Interest Rate: 12% annually
- Term: 3 years

**Calculation**:
- Monthly Payment: $498.21
- Total Interest: $2,935
- Total Paid: $17,935

**Key Insight**: Higher interest rates significantly increase total cost

### Example 5: Student Loan
**Scenario**: $50,000 student loan with income-driven repayment
- Loan Amount: $50,000
- Interest Rate: 6.8% annually
- Term: 20 years

**Calculation**:
- Monthly Payment: $381.93
- Total Interest: $41,663
- Total Paid: $91,663

**Key Insight**: Long terms with high balances result in significant interest costs
