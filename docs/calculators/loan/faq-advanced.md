## Advanced Topics FAQ (Q15-Q20)

### Q15: How do I calculate loan-to-value ratio?

**Answer**: LTV calculation:

- LTV = Loan amount ÷ Property value
- Higher LTV = higher risk = higher rate
- Lower LTV = lower risk = lower rate
- Aim for LTV < 80% to avoid PMI

**LTV Example**:

```
Property value: $400,000
Loan amount: $320,000
LTV: $320,000 ÷ $400,000 = 80%
PMI required: Yes (LTV > 80%)
```

**LTV Impact on Rates**:

- LTV < 80%: Best rates
- LTV 80-90%: Slightly higher rates
- LTV > 90%: Higher rates + PMI

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate your LTV
2. Consider larger down payment
3. Shop for best rates
4. Factor in PMI costs

### Q16: What if I have bad credit?

**Answer**: Options for bad credit:

- Improve credit score first
- Consider FHA loans (lower credit requirements)
- Find co-signer
- Save larger down payment
- Shop for subprime lenders

**Credit Score Impact**:

```
Excellent (740+): Best rates
Good (680-739): Good rates
Fair (620-679): Higher rates
Poor (<620): Much higher rates
```

**Improving Credit Score**:

- Pay bills on time

**Next Steps**:

1. Check your credit score

3. Consider FHA loans
4. Shop around for best terms

### Q17: How do I handle multiple loan applications?

```
