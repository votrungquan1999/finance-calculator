## Loan Basics FAQ (Q1-Q7)

### Q1: Should I choose 15-year or 30-year mortgage?

**Answer**: Consider your priorities:

- 15-year: Higher payments, less total interest, faster payoff
- 30-year: Lower payments, more total interest, more flexibility
- Compare total cost vs monthly payment
- Consider your cash flow and other goals

**Payment Comparison Example**:

```
$300,000 loan at 6.5%:
- 30-year: $1,896/month, $382,320 total interest
- 15-year: $2,611/month, $170,000 total interest
- Difference: $715/month, $212,320 interest saved
```

**Decision Factors**:

- Monthly payment affordability
- Total interest cost
- Opportunity cost of extra payment
- Flexibility needs
- Other financial goals

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate both payment options
2. Assess monthly payment affordability
3. Consider opportunity cost
4. Factor in other financial goals

### Q2: How much can I save with extra payments?

**Answer**: Extra payments can save significant interest:

- $100 extra/month on $300k mortgage: ~$25k interest saved
- $200 extra/month: ~$45k interest saved
- Use extra payment calculator to see exact savings
- Consider opportunity cost of extra payments

**Extra Payment Example**:

```
$300,000 mortgage, 6.5%, 30 years:
- Regular payment: $1,896/month
- Extra payment: $200/month
- Total payment: $2,096/month
- Interest saved: $45,000
- Time saved: 4.2 years
```

**When Extra Payments Make Sense**:

- Interest rate > 6%
- No better investment opportunities
- Want to eliminate debt faster
- Psychological benefits

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate potential interest savings
2. Compare to investment returns
3. Consider your risk tolerance
4. Make informed decision

### Q3: What's the difference between APR and interest rate?

**Answer**: Key differences:

- Interest rate: Cost of borrowing principal
- APR: Total cost including fees and points
- APR is higher than interest rate
- Use APR to compare loans
- Interest rate for payment calculations

**APR vs Interest Rate Example**:

```
Loan: $300,000, 6.5% rate, 2% points
- Interest rate: 6.5%
- APR: 6.8% (includes points)
- Points cost: $6,000
- APR shows true cost
```

**Why APR Matters**:

- Shows true cost of borrowing
- Includes all fees and points
- Allows apples-to-apples comparison
- Helps make informed decisions

**Next Steps**:

1. Always compare APR, not just rate
2. Ask for APR on all loan quotes
3. Factor in all costs
4. Choose loan with lowest APR

### Q4: Should I pay points to lower my rate?

**Answer**: Points can be worth it if:

- You plan to stay in home long enough to break even
- Break-even = Points cost ÷ Monthly savings
- Consider your timeline and cash flow
- Compare with investing the points money

**Points Analysis Example**:

```
Loan: $300,000, 30 years
- No points: 6.5% rate, $1,896 payment
- 2 points: 6.0% rate, $1,798 payment
- Points cost: $6,000
- Monthly savings: $98
- Break-even: $6,000 ÷ $98 = 61 months (5.1 years)
```

**When Points Make Sense**:

- Staying in home > 5 years
- Have cash for points
- No better investment opportunities
- Want to minimize long-term cost

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate break-even point
2. Assess how long you'll stay
3. Compare to investment returns
4. Make informed decision

### Q5: When does refinancing make sense?

**Answer**: Refinancing makes sense when:

- Rate drop of 0.5% or more
- Break-even point within 2-3 years
- Planning to stay in home long enough
- Closing costs are reasonable
- Consider your current loan terms

**Refinance Analysis Example**:

```
Current: $300,000, 6.5%, 25 years left, $1,896 payment
New: $300,000, 5.5%, 30 years, $1,703 payment
Closing costs: $6,000
Monthly savings: $193
Break-even: $6,000 ÷ $193 = 31 months
```

**Refinance Considerations**:

- Rate difference
- Closing costs
- Time in home
- Current loan terms
- Market conditions

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate break-even point
2. Consider your timeline
3. Shop around for best rates
4. Factor in all costs

### Q6: How do I calculate total interest paid?

**Answer**: Total interest calculation:

- Total interest = (Monthly payment × Total payments) - Principal
- Use amortization schedule for detailed breakdown
- Consider extra payments impact
- Factor in refinancing savings

**Total Interest Example**:

```
$300,000 loan, 6.5%, 30 years:
- Monthly payment: $1,896
- Total payments: $1,896 × 360 = $682,560
- Principal: $300,000
- Total interest: $682,560 - $300,000 = $382,560
```

**Reducing Total Interest**:

- Make extra payments
- Choose shorter term
- Refinance to lower rate
- Make bi-weekly payments

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate total interest on current loan
2. Compare different loan options
3. Consider extra payment strategies
4. Factor in refinancing opportunities

### Q7: What's the difference between the three loan types?

**Answer**: Key differences:

- Equal Payment: Fixed payment, early payments mostly interest
- Declining Balance: Decreasing payment, fixed principal
- With Fee: Includes upfront costs in calculation
- Choose based on your needs and market availability

**Payment Comparison**:

```
$300,000 loan, 6.5%, 30 years:
- Equal Payment: $1,896/month (constant)
- Declining Balance: $2,125 → $1,550 (decreasing)
- With Fee: $1,896/month (includes fees)
```

**When to Use Each**:

- Equal Payment: Most common, predictable payments
- Declining Balance: Want to minimize interest
- With Fee: Comparing loans with different fees

**Next Steps**:

1. Understand each loan type
2. Choose based on your needs
3. Compare total costs
4. Consider payment predictability
