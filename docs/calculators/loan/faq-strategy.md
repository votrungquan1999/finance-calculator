**Mortgage vs Investment Example**:

- Reduces principal faster
- Saves interest over loan life

**Bi-Weekly Payment Example**:

```
Monthly payment: $1,896
Bi-weekly payment: $948
Annual difference: $1,896 (13th payment)
Interest saved: ~$25,000 over 30 years
Time saved: ~4 years
```

**Bi-Weekly Benefits**:

- Automatic extra payment
- Reduces principal faster
- Saves significant interest

**Next Steps**:

1. Calculate bi-weekly payment amount
2. Set up automatic payments
3. Monitor interest savings

### Q10: What's the impact of a 0.5% rate difference?

**Answer**: 0.5% rate difference impact:

- $300k mortgage: ~$90/month payment difference
- Total interest difference: ~$32k over 30 years
- Significant long-term savings
- Worth shopping around for better rates

**Rate Difference Example**:

```
$300,000 mortgage, 30 years:
- 6.5% rate: $1,896/month, $382,320 interest
- 6.0% rate: $1,799/month, $347,220 interest

```

**Shopping for Rates**:

### Q11: How do I handle prepayment penalties?

**Answer**: Prepayment penalty considerations:

- Check if your loan has prepayment penalties
- Calculate cost vs benefit of extra payments
- Consider refinancing to remove penalties

**Prepayment Penalty Example**:

```
Loan: $300,000, 6.5%, 30 years
Prepayment penalty: 2% of remaining balance
Extra payment: $200/month
Penalty cost: $6,000
Interest saved: $45,000
Net benefit: $39,000
```

**Avoiding Prepayment Penalties**:

- Choose loans without penalties

**Next Steps**:

1. Check for prepayment penalties

- Improve credit score first

**Payment Reduction Strategies**:

```
$300,000 loan, 6.5%:

- 5.5% rate: $1,703/month
- $250,000 loan: $1,580/month
```

**When to Wait**:

- Market conditions poor

**Next Steps**:

4. Shop around for best terms

### Q13: How do I compare loan offers?

**Answer**: Compare these key factors:

```
Rate: 6.5% vs 6.0%
APR: 6.8% vs 6.2%

3. Read all terms carefully
4. Choose best overall deal

### Q14: What's the difference between fixed and adjustable rates?

**Answer**: Key differences:

- Fixed: Rate stays same for entire loan
- Adjustable: Rate changes based on market
- Fixed: Predictable payments, higher initial rate
- Adjustable: Lower initial rate, payment uncertainty

**Rate Comparison Example**:

```
$300,000 loan, 30 years:
- Fixed 6.5%: $1,896/month (constant)
- ARM 5.5%: $1,703/month (initial)
- ARM cap: 8.5% maximum
- Adjustment period: 5 years
```

**When to Choose Each**:

- Fixed: Long-term stability, rising rates
- ARM: Short-term ownership, falling rates
- Consider your timeline and risk tolerance

**Next Steps**:

1. Understand both rate types
2. Consider your timeline
3. Assess rate trends
