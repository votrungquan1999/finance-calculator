## Common Scenarios

### First-Time Homebuyer

**Typical Situation**:
- Loan Amount: $250,000

- Term: 30 years
- Down Payment: 5-20%

**Key Considerations**:
- PMI required if down payment <20%
- Closing costs: 2-5% of loan amount

- Total monthly payment: P&I + taxes + insurance + PMI

**Example Calculation**:
- Monthly P&I: $1,580.17
- Property Tax: $300/month
- Insurance: $100/month
- PMI: $150/month
- Total Payment: $2,130.17

### Debt Consolidation

**Typical Situation**:
- Consolidate multiple high-interest debts
- Use home equity or personal loan
- Lower overall interest rate

**Example**: Consolidate $50,000 in credit card debt
- Credit Card Rate: 18%
- Personal Loan Rate: 8%
- Term: 5 years

**Analysis**:
- Credit Card Payment: $1,268/month
- Personal Loan Payment: $1,014/month
- Monthly Savings: $254
- Total Interest Saved: $15,240

### Investment Property

**Typical Situation**:
- Purchase rental property
- Higher interest rate than primary residence
- Consider cash flow and appreciation

**Example**: $200,000 rental property
- Interest Rate: 7.5%
- Term: 30 years
- Monthly Payment: $1,398.43
- Expected Rent: $1,800/month
- Cash Flow: $401.57/month

**Key Considerations**:
- Vacancy rate: 5-10%
- Maintenance: 1-2% of property value
- Property management: 8-12% of rent
- Tax benefits: Depreciation, interest deduction

## Best Practices

### Before Getting a Loan

1. **Shop Around**: Compare rates from multiple lenders
2. **Check Credit**: Higher scores get better rates
3. **Calculate Affordability**: Payment should be <28% of income
4. **Consider All Costs**: Include taxes, insurance, PMI
5. **Plan for the Future**: Consider income stability

### During Loan Shopping

1. **Get Pre-approved**: Know your borrowing power
2. **Lock Your Rate**: Protect against rate increases
3. **Read Everything**: Understand all terms and conditions
4. **Ask Questions**: Clarify anything unclear
5. **Compare Apples to Apples**: Same loan amount and term

### After Getting the Loan

1. **Make Extra Payments**: Reduce total interest paid
2. **Consider Refinancing**: When rates drop significantly
3. **Monitor Your Credit**: Maintain good credit score
4. **Review Annually**: Check if refinancing makes sense
5. **Pay On Time**: Avoid late fees and credit damage

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Only Looking at Monthly Payment
**Problem**: Ignoring total cost of loan
**Solution**: Calculate total interest over loan term

**Example**:
- 30-year loan: $1,500/month = $540,000 total
- 15-year loan: $2,000/month = $360,000 total
- 15-year saves $180,000 despite higher payment

### Mistake 2: Not Shopping Around
**Problem**: Accepting first offer
**Solution**: Get quotes from multiple lenders

**Potential Savings**:
- Rate difference: 0.25-0.5%
- On $300,000 loan: $15,000-30,000 savings
- Always get at least 3 quotes

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Closing Costs
**Problem**: Not factoring in all costs
**Solution**: Include all fees in comparison

**Typical Closing Costs**:
- Origination fee: 0.5-1%
- Appraisal: $300-500
- Title insurance: $1,000-2,000
- Recording fees: $100-300
- Total: 2-5% of loan amount

### Mistake 4: Not Considering Future Plans
**Problem**: Choosing wrong term length
**Solution**: Consider how long you'll keep the loan

**Questions to Ask**:
- Will you move in 5 years?
- Do you plan to pay off early?
- Is your income stable?
- Do you have other financial goals?

### Mistake 5: Not Reading the Fine Print
**Problem**: Missing important terms
**Solution**: Read and understand all loan documents

**Key Terms to Understand**:
- Prepayment penalties
- Rate lock period
- Escrow requirements
- Late payment fees
- Default consequences
