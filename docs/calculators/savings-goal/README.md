## Priority-Based Allocation

### 🎯 Priority Levels

| ------------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Critical** | Essential for financial security | 50-70% of savings | Emergency fund, debt payoff  |
| **High**     | Important life goals             | 20-30% of savings | Home down payment, education |

| **Low**      | Nice to have                     | 0-10% of savings  | Luxury items, entertainment  |

### 📊 Allocation Strategies

<details>
<summary><strong>💰 Fixed Percentage Method</strong></summary>

**How it works:**

- Assign fixed percentages to each priority level
- Allocate monthly savings based on percentages
- Adjust as goals are completed

**Example:**

- Critical: 60% ($600/month)
- High: 25% ($250/month)
- Medium: 15% ($150/month)

**Best for:** Consistent income, stable goals

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Goal-First Method</strong></summary>

**How it works:**

- Focus on one goal at a time
- Complete highest priority goal first
- Move to next goal when first is complete

**Example:**

1. Emergency fund ($10,000) - 6 months
2. Home down payment ($50,000) - 2 years
3. Vacation ($5,000) - 6 months

**Best for:** Focused approach, limited resources

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚖️ Balanced Method</strong></summary>

**How it works:**

- Allocate based on goal urgency and importance
- Consider timeline and priority together
- Adjust monthly based on progress

**Example:**

- Urgent + High Priority: 40%
- Important + Medium Timeline: 30%
- Desirable + Long Timeline: 20%
- Flexible + Low Priority: 10%

**Best for:** Multiple goals, varying timelines

</details>

## Inflation Adjustment

### 📈 Why Inflation Matters

**Example: $50,000 Home Down Payment**

- **Today's Cost:** $50,000
- **In 5 Years (3% inflation):** $57,964
- **Additional Needed:** $7,964
- **Monthly Increase:** $133

### 🧮 Inflation Calculation Methods

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Historical Average Method</strong></summary>

**Formula:** Future Value = Present Value × (1 + Inflation Rate)^Years

**Example:**

- Goal: $30,000 vacation in 3 years
- Inflation: 3% annually
- Future Value: $30,000 × (1.03)³ = $32,782
- Additional Needed: $2,782

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Category-Specific Inflation</strong></summary>

**Different inflation rates by category:**

- **Education:** 5-7% annually
- **Healthcare:** 4-6% annually
- **General:** 2-3% annually
- **Housing:** 3-4% annually

**More accurate but complex**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📈 Conservative Method</strong></summary>

**Use higher inflation rate for safety:**

- **Standard:** 3% inflation
- **Conservative:** 4-5% inflation
- **Very Conservative:** 6% inflation

**Builds in safety margin**
