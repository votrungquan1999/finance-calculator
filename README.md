## 🤖 Vibe Coding Project

This project was built as a **vibe coding** experiment - exploring AI agent capabilities through structured prompts and rules without direct user control. The goal is to understand how well an AI agent can architect, develop, and maintain a complete software project when given comprehensive guidelines and allowed to work autonomously. This serves as a testbed for evaluating AI-driven development workflows and agent autonomy in real-world software engineering scenarios.
